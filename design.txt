Create a quiz that sorts the user into a Hogwarts house, and stores all quiz takers in a 'students' database linked to a 'houses' database.
User will be asked basic questions: name, gender, and if they have an interest in quidditch.
Users answer 5-10 multiple choice questions, of which each answer is designated towards a specific house.
Answers assign points to a specific house value.
The final question will ask the user if they have a house preference. If their answer matches a house, that house is given 2 extra points in their ranking.
The quiz will then let them know what house they are sorted into, storing that value as well as the ranking of the other houses.
The data will be stored within the students database.
With each update to the students database, the 'number of students' value in the houses database is updated.
The student will be shown a message along the lines of: "The sorting hat places you in ____, where you will join _ other students!"
